Stuff I love: Lambiek.  
<figure style="width: 389px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" alt="Lambiek poster" src="http://www.lambiek.net/news/img/1024-155-940-q8v.jpg" width="389" height="185" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lambiek poster</figcaption></figure>

I first visited [Lambiek](http://www.lambiek.net/ "Lambiek website") in the late 1980s &#8211; and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s changed much since. It&#8217;s a large shop (certainly by Dutch standards), with bookshelves, tables, and display racks groaning under the weight of a HUGE number of Dutch, English and French comics and graphic novels, new, second-hand and collectable.

The guys who run the place obviously love comics, and they are always happy to recommend something new and unexpected. Lambiek, to me, is what a shop should be &#8211; personal, run by passionate people, and full of books.
