I always get my bike serviced at [Howard Powell&#8217;s motorcycles](http://www.howardpowellmotorcycles.co.uk/index.html "Howard Powell website. ") in East Ham. They do a good job, are reasonably priced, and always take care to explain what matters and what doesn&#8217;t. As they aren&#8217;t a main dealer, it can be time consuming to get parts &#8211; my Kawasaki needed a wiring loom (whatever that is), which took a few days, but they make up for it with friendliness and reliability.
