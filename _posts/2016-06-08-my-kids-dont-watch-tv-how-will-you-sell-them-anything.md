## Familiarity ≠best

Advertising seeks to persuade human beings to make one choice over another. A big part of this has been taking advantage of our tendency to substitute hard questions (&#8220;which can of beans would be the rationally best choice?&#8221;) for easier questions &#8211; very often substituting &#8220;best&#8221; for &#8220;most familiar&#8221;. Daniel Kahneman&#8217;s book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0141033576/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=0141033576&linkCode=as2&tag=kuytcom-21" rel="nofollow">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><img loading="lazy" style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=kuytcom-21&l=as2&o=2&a=0141033576" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> includes a chapter on this.

Much of the effectiveness of advertising depends on this principle &#8211; instead of evaluating the price, quality, nutritional benefits of a can of beans, the advertisers hope we&#8217;ll remember &#8220;Beans means Heinz&#8221;.

That strategy works &#8211; especially for products where we don&#8217;t expect a big upside from expending the effort to make a &#8220;better&#8221; choice (will that other can of beans really be so much better?), or where the downside of a wrong choice is (perceived as) high &#8211; I&#8217;ve never heard of car brand x, it&#8217;s safer to stay with a brand I&#8217;ve heard of.

But there are some powerful forces eroding the magic bullet of familiarity.

### Howling into the void

Becoming &#8220;familiar&#8221; was never easy &#8211; you&#8217;d need a memorable message, you&#8217;d need a big budget to put it in front of your target audience, and you&#8217;d have to hammer home the message over many years. Today, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s even possible any more &#8211; no matter how much advertising spend you have, becoming &#8220;familiar&#8221; just through advertising would be unthinkable (if you&#8217;re aiming at a mainstream audience).

People are actively avoiding advertising if they can; if they can&#8217;t they ignore it. The decline of print audiences, and the fragmentation of linear TV means the &#8220;old&#8221; channels are becoming much less effective (even ignoring the fact that linear TV as a medium doesn&#8217;t look like it has a great future &#8211; nobody I know watches &#8220;TV&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s all streaming, on-demand, box-set and event-based viewing).

The big business success stories of the last decade &#8211; Facebook, Google, Amazon, Uber, AirBnB etc. &#8211; don&#8217;t advertise much. They use word-of-mouth and built-in mechanics like referral schemes &#8211; but most of all, they have a great, useful product.

### From information scarcity to abundance

The &#8220;familiarity&#8221; model is based on information scarcity. If I have to chose a product in a super market, and I have no other information to hand,  instead of reading the label and making a comparison with similar products, it&#8217;s tempting to go for &#8220;which product have I heard of&#8221;.

And it&#8217;s not all that long ago that consumers didn&#8217;t have access to much other information. Before the Internet, you might know a few friends&#8217; and family members&#8217; opinion on something; you might read a magazine or a book; you might, for an important purchase, order a report from a consumers&#8217; organisation.

Today, you can find out instantly what all your friends and family think about a product by asking on a social channel. You can find out what strangers think on review sites. You can find out every aspect of the product or service by running a quick search. And as we are all consuming more &#8220;information&#8221; every day, the chances of having no other information available are declining.

So, to become &#8220;familiar&#8221; is harder, more expensive, and less effective.

## The end of the &#8220;Friday afternoon car&#8221; {#EndOfFridayAfternoonCar}

In the 1980s, a friend bought a brand new car; it was an MG Metro. She owned the car for about 2 months before it broke down, so she took it back to the garage for a repair. 3 weeks later, it broke down again; after 6 months, the car had been back for 4 repairs. The mechanic at the garage introduced me to the phrase &#8220;Friday afternoon car&#8221; &#8211; the idea was that the factory workers wanted to get home for the weekend, so cars built on a Friday afternoon would be rushed, and suffer from problems.

It&#8217;s now pretty much impossible to buy a Friday afternoon car &#8211; even the cheapest, least prestigious car manufacturer is delivering a high-quality product that will do exactly what you expect, and will easily outlast its warranty period.

The same is true of most consumer goods (financial services are a notorious exception) &#8211; supermarket own-brand beans may taste different to the brand names, but they aren&#8217;t &#8220;worse&#8221;. Clothes from a discount store will last just as long as those from a high-street chain. You can watch NetFlix on a discount laptop just as well as on an Apple.

The value of &#8220;brand&#8221; and &#8220;familiarity&#8221; in customer decision making is declining &#8211; now that you cannot buy a &#8220;bad&#8221; product any more, the safety of going with the familiar brand is declining in importance.
