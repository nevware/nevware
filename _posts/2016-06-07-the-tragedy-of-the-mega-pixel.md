A few years ago, I met an executive from a large camera company. Before digital photography came along, this company&#8217;s marketing (and manufacturing) emphasis had been on the quality of their lenses. This isÂ  subjective field &#8211; you can use focal length and aperture as a proximate measure, but no serious photographer would equate a &#8220;no-name&#8221; lense with the same metrix with a lense from a well-known manufacturer.

And you know what? It was broadly right &#8211; a good lens meant a better photo.

Then the digital camera came along &#8211; and now people buy cameras based on one simple metric: the number of megapixels. This is [not really correlated to image quality](http://www.photoreview.com.au/guides/pocket-guides/digital-photography/How-Many-Megapixels-Do-You-REALLY-Need) for most people (unless you want to print a photo to cover a bus shelter). But it allows consumers to compare products using a nice, simple metric &#8211; camera x has 12 megapixels for $200, camera y has 15 megapixels for $200 &#8211; camera y is the best deal&#8221;.

The camera executive called this phenomenon &#8220;the tragedy of the mega-pixel&#8221; &#8211; he said his company culture had changed. The focus on lens quality was still there &#8211; but it wasn&#8217;t commercially meaningful in the short term. When it came to dollars, it was better to invest in mega pixels than glass.
