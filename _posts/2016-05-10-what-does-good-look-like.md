In traditional &#8220;waterfall&#8221; software development, &#8220;good&#8221; software meets the written requirements. No matter how bad the requirements &#8211; &#8220;good&#8221; software meets the requirements.

In agile software development, &#8220;good&#8221; software meets the quality goals set by the team, and delivers the features defined by the product owner. No matter how deluded the product owner.

Both models seem unsatisfactory.
