I&#8217;ve long been a fan of Ivar Jacobson&#8217;s work &#8211; I attended a seminar he ran a few years ago on the topic of the Essential Unified Process, and it inspired me to introduce practices at my work place as a way of capturing the way we work &#8211; not just in technology, but across nearly all our disciplines.

Sadly, the Essential Unified Process didn&#8217;t really follow up on its promise for me &#8211; maybe I&#8217;m impatient, but the cards on which it depends didn&#8217;t get published in a place I could find, there was talk of a book that never happened, and I kinda lost interest.

A few days ago, I got an email from Ivar Jacobson International, announcing a new book &#8211; “The Essence of Software Engineering: The SEMAT Kernel”. I bought it, and read it. It was a disappointment. I kinda agree with the sentiment behind [SEMAT](http://semat.org/ "SEMAT website") &#8211; establishing the common practices by which we build software seems a good idea. What bothered me was that the book was very unfocused. Partly, it explained SEMAT and the processes by which it had arisen; it uses a story construct to introduce the various concepts within SEMAT, and it discusses the ideas behind those concepts. It just didn&#8217;t feel very actionable, and I felt that the organizational interruptions explaining the SEMAT background made the book significantly worse &#8211; I found myself skipping through paragraphs, then pages, and felt I&#8217;d extracted everything of value in 2 hours.

This is a shame &#8211; I believe that Jacobson&#8217;s focus on &#8220;practices&#8221; is hugely valuable, I love the &#8220;card&#8221; based approach, and the basic idea of capturing &#8220;what we know works&#8221; in software development makes sense. It just needs a book everyone can rally behind &#8211; much as Kent Beck&#8217;s &#8220;Extreme Programming&#8221;, Martin Fowler&#8217;s &#8220;Refactoring&#8221;, and the &#8220;Pragmatic Programmer&#8221; book built a wide consensus on their topics.
