I had a quick dinner at [Le Pain Quotidien on the King&#8217;s Road](http://www.lepainquotidien.co.uk/store/chelsea-2/#.VGje5ecih58) last week. I chose the Chicken Cassoulet, and found it rather uninspired.

So this weekend, I made my own version. It&#8217;s inspired by the Jamie Oliver &#8220;Essex cassoulet&#8221;, but perhaps a little easier. Enjoy.

Serves 3 &#8211; 4.

Ingredients:

  * Chicken legs, thighs and drumsticks &#8211; around 500 grams
  * 3 decent sizedÂ  spicy sausages &#8211; Toulouse, or Merguez
  * Ham bits &#8211; off-cuts from the deli counter are perfect; around 200 gram
  * Garlic (4 cloves)
  * A nutmeg
  * Bay leaves (4 &#8211; 6)
  * Fresh rosemary
  * Fresh thyme
  * a carrot
  * a leek
  * half a bunch of celery
  * a decent oil (rapeseed oil or olive oil)
  * a tin of tomatoes
  * a tin of white beans
  * a handful of lentils
  * a glass of robust red wine

Start by heating the oil to a decent level, and fry the (generously seasoned) chicken golden brown in a big, heavy pan. While the chicken&#8217;s frying, finely chop the garlic, leek, carrot and celery. Once the chicken is browned, add these to the pan. Leave to fry for a bit, then turn down the heat a little &#8211; we want the leek to turn transparent, but not burn.

In the mean time, chop the leaves of the thyme and rosemary, add to the pan, with 4 bay leaves. Grate in around half the nutmeg, with a generous helping of salt and pepper. Add the sausages and the ham.

Once the leek has taken a bit of colour, add the wine, tomatoes, lentils and beans. Add a small amount of water if the mix looks too dry.

Turn the heat down to a slow simmer, and cover the pan.

Leave to simmer for around 90 minutes. The chicken should fall off the bone; the broth should be rich and fragrant. Serve with brown bread.
