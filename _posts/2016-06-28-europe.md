I feel European. If I shared any of [cousin Dirk](http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=36524)&#8216;s talents, I&#8217;d qualify to play football for 3 countries. I grew up speaking English at home, Dutch at school, and [Frisian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Frisian_language) with my friends in the playground (though I never got the hang of [Sneekers)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneek). Growing up, school and music trips went to France, Belgium and Germany; I can read a news paper in French, German, Italian and Spanish. I have friends and colleagues from around half the 27 remaining Eurozone countries.

I love classical music from the continent &#8211; Bach, Mozart, Vivaldi, de Falla, Lully, Beethoven, Sweelinck. I love continental food. I love continental cities. I love continental European comics &#8211; Franquin, Herg√©, Toonder.

I&#8217;ve chosen to live in the UK for the last 30 years &#8211; I love the UK too. London is an amazing city. Many of my favourite authors &#8211; Martin Amis, William Boyd, David Mitchel &#8211; are British. The BBC is amazing. Even the food is getting better.

But now, after the vote to leave the EU, it feels like I have to chose. It&#8217;s not clear what the UK&#8217;s relationship with Europe will be &#8211; but I fear the worst.
