I found an article online about [re-setting your sleep patterns.Â ](http://localhost:4000/sleep-and-relaxation.html)

I&#8217;ve tried this myself, repeatedly &#8211; it&#8217;s a great way to re-set. I still struggle with insomnia sometimes, and this routine is what I follow when it all gets out of whack. The thing I&#8217;d add is that I make sure I&#8217;m properly hydrated before going to sleep &#8211; typically by drinking a pint of water half an hour before I go to sleep.
