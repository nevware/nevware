I bought Robin Sloan&#8217;s book &#8220;[Mr Penumbra&#8217;s 24 hour bookshop](http://www.robinsloan.com/penumbra/ "Robin Sloan's site")&#8220;, and loved it! The book plays with lots of technology themes &#8211; cloud computing, cryptography, data visualization &#8211; as well as other geeky concerns like the way Google might work, typography, and special effects.

The story in the book hinges on a brilliant perspective shift, which literally had me grinning at the ingenuity. Many of the locations &#8211; not least, Mr Penumbra&#8217;s bookshop &#8211; make you wish they were real. One of the characters has built a business out of modelling the physics of the human female body &#8211; okay, mostly breasts &#8211; and that alone made me laugh out loud.

Thoroughly recommended!
