I stumbled across [Late Junction](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006tp52 "BBC site for late junction") about 6 years ago &#8211; it was a late evening, I&#8217;d had a tough few days at work, and got home from a long day in the office just after 10 in the evening. I made myself a quick snack, and turned on the radio &#8211; Radio 3 had a nice bit of Bach tinkling along, and I listened to it whilst staring out the window, into what seemed a dark and stormy night, feeling grumpy. When the Bach program ended, the announcer burbled on briefly about a program called Late Junction; I left the radio on and went to brush my teeth. When I got back to the radio, I heard some utterly unexpected craziness from [Yann Tiersen](http://www.yanntiersen.fr/), and was hooked &#8211; I stayed up till after midnight listening to Late Junction&#8217;s eclectic mix of music.

Since then, whenever I want some musical inspiration, I listen to Late Junction &#8211; it&#8217;s unpredictable, and every episode seems to have one track I hate, and one track I absolutely love.
