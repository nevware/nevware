Carpaccio is one of my favourite summer dishes. My variant uses dry-brined steak, and Lancashire cheese, rather than Parmesan &#8211; the combination of tangy, creamy cheese with the raw beef is very summery.

Ingredients:

  * Fillet steak; one per person.
  * Lancashire cheese (I like [Mrs Kirkham&#8217;s](http://www.mrskirkhams.com/ "Mrs Kirkham's website"))
  * Rocket leaves
  * Spinach leaves (salad quality)
  * A light vinaigrette
  * Coarse salt
  * A clove of garlic, peeled

I start by dry-brining the meat. This is a technique I picked up from Tim Ferris&#8217;s &#8220;[4 hour chef](http://fourhourchef.com/ "Tim Ferris - 4 Hour Chef")&#8221; book. It turns a regular steak into something special. For the carpaccio, I rub a clove of garlic over the meat, the put the meat on a plate, sprinkle on a pinch of salt (slightly more than you&#8217;d use at the table), and pop it in the fridge for at least 2 hours.

When it&#8217;s time to serve, layer the rocket and spinach leaves on a serving plate, slice the steak as thinly as you can &#8211; but don&#8217;t stress about the meat being slightly thicker than you&#8217;d see in a restaurant. Slice the cheese &#8211; it will crumble, and that&#8217;s okay. Layer the meat with a little cheese; I like roughly twice as much meat as cheese, but whatever works for you.

Add the vinaigrette &#8211; I prefer to use only a drop or two.

Serve.
