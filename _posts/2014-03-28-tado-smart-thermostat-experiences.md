Just before Christmas, I bought a Tado (http://www.tado.com/de-en/) smart thermostat online. Here&#8217;s what happened…

Firstly, the despatch date got pushed back – from early January to mid February. The email notifications were worded a little awkwardly, and I did start to wonder if Tado even existed. Eventually, they dispatched the item, and Parcelforce cocked up the delivery – for some bizarre reason, they&#8217;d changed the delivery address, failed to deliver, and not left a &#8220;while you were out&#8221; note; this required a bit of chasing around. Tado are based in Germany, and use DHL; they don&#8217;t give you a tracking number in the despatch email, so that requires a help desk interaction; DHL can&#8217;t track Parcelforce deliveries. Not really Tado&#8217;s fault, but frustrating nonetheless.

The Tado packaging is rather well put together – but there are a lot of different bits and pieces. There are the Tado box, the Tado internet gateway, and the temperature sensor; there are USB charging plugs, and USB cables, and a network cable; various screws, wall plugs and other a screw driver.

I installed the Tado smart thermostat this weekend; the process is guided by a web application, which can check whether you&#8217;ve set everything up correctly, and it was pretty straightforward, even though my boiler and thermostat weren&#8217;t in Tado&#8217;s list of known devices.

So, now I&#8217;ve got it up and running, I&#8217;m very impressed. There&#8217;s a web application which allows you to control the heating and set up your preferences – what time you want to go to &#8220;sleep&#8221; mode, the preferred temperatures, the devices that can connect to your Tado. There&#8217;s a smart phone app which monitors your location, and automatically switches off the heating when you&#8217;re out of the house, and provides basic reports. When I left home, I could see that the heating switched itself off; when I got back home, the heating was on as Tado had sensed I was on my way home.

It&#8217;s not perfect – it would be nice to have more control from the mobile app (it&#8217;s pretty much read-only). As a programmer, I&#8217;d love Tado to be open to hackers – they&#8217;ve gone to great lengths to lock down their toys, and that means I can&#8217;t use the Tado information to do other things, like program my X10 home automation system to use the Tado location information to switch off the hot water when I&#8217;m away.

I live on a boat, and my central heating is fueled by diesel – my heating costs are higher than a regular gas central heating system, and Tado doesn&#8217;t really allow me to put that information in, so the &#8220;cost&#8221; and &#8220;savings&#8221; statistics they provide are not very accurate; as they use a secret, proprietary algorithm to calculate savings, I&#8217;m not entirely sure I believe them anyway..

A more pragmatic concern with this lack of openness is that my heating is now tightly coupled to Tado&#8217;s commercial success – if they go bust, the Tado gadget stops working.
