We went to Paris for a few days last week, and ended up in [La Petite Perigourdine](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g187147-d850136-Reviews-La_Petite_Perigourdine-Paris_Ile_de_France.html) for dinner. It&#8217;s a corner restaurant, a few hundred yards from the tourist hotspots near Notre Dame on the left bank, and we chose it because it looked busy with local people.

The food was great &#8211; the onion soup was pretty much the perfect implementation of a French classic &#8211; rich, dark, wintery. My steak was perfectly cooked, and the seasoning was superb &#8211; it brought a relatively simple cut of beef and turned it into a classic. We had a great bottle of wine &#8211; the Cuvée Mirabelle from Château de la Jaubertie. Not hugely expensive, but as a dry white, it&#8217;s amazingly complex, with oak notes, and a great mouth feel.

One of the new discoveries for me was served with my steak &#8211; a dish called aligot. My steak arrived on a big plate, otherwise empty; the waiter arrived with a copper pan with a semi-liquid substance, and poured it on my plate with some panache. The smell was amazing &#8211; cheese and garlic, but not overwhelming. When I tasted it, the texture was rather dense &#8211; but pleasingly so. The flavour was rich and intense &#8211; a combination of fragrant garlic, tangy cheese and soft potato. It was clear that this dish would take years off my life, but it would be worth it.

Once home, I set about recreating the dish. I found a few recipes, but none were convincing &#8211; so I experimented, and I think I&#8217;ve stumbled on the correct way. It&#8217;s an easy enough dish, but the timing is fairly unforgiving &#8211; once you&#8217;ve created the mash, you should serve it immediately or it turns into glue.

### Recipe

_This recipe is for 2 people &#8211; scale up as required._

Boil a kettle.

Then, start by peeling _potatoes_ &#8211; I use charlotte potatoes, they&#8217;re nice and waxy &#8211; and cut them into similarly sized chunks. Depending on their size, I use 5 small or 3 medium size potatoes to feed 2.

Put the potatoes in a steamer, add a bit of salt, and pour boiling water from the kettle into the pan under the steamer. Steam the potatoes until done &#8211; around 15 minutes.

Put a big knob of _butter_ &#8211; around 50 grams &#8211; into a sauce pan, and heat very gently.

Finely chop or mince _3 cloves of garlic_, and add to the butter. Don&#8217;t let the butter turn brown &#8211; y0u want it warm, but don&#8217;t let the garlic change colour.

Once the potatoes are cooked, tip them into a mixing bowl or into a clean, dry saucepan. A little moisture is okay, but you want the potatoes to be fairly dry. If you can keep the repository warm, it will help the process.

Pour the garlic-infused butter into the potatoes.

Add three generous handfuls of _grated Lancashire cheese _to the potatoes (the French use a cheese called [Cantal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantal_cheese)), and use an electric whisk to turn this mixture into mash. Add salt and pepper whilst whisking &#8211; I also like to add a tiny bit of nutmeg.

The whisking will be messy &#8211; but after a few minutes, the substance will turn soft, fluffy, almost like bread dough. Serve immediately.
