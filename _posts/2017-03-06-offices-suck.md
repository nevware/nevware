About 5 years ago, people realized that they had better IT from Google, Microsoft and LinkedIn than they got from their own IT. Their home devices were much nicer to use, and much easier to live with, than their work laptop. They got free, unlimited email from Google, with amazing search while their IT department limited their mailbox.

&nbsp;

This caused a bit of a corporate revolution, commonly known as “BYOD” or “bring your own device”. My girlfriend works for a local council (hardly a trailblazer), and doesn’t get a work laptop – instead, she gets a budget and some limits, and goes and buys her own laptop.

&nbsp;

The same will happen with IoT.

&nbsp;

At home I can tell Alexa to turn up the heat, or dim the lights, or play some music. I can see what the weather’s going to be when I leave home by looking at my alarm clock, and I know that the heating will come on when people are home, and stop when they leave.

&nbsp;

At work, the HVAC works on a timer. The lights are on or off (mostly on) because I switch them on or off. If I’m cold, I put on a sweater. If I’m hot – well, HR have asked me not to disrobe anymore. If my colleagues decide to play pumping dance music, I have the option of wearing headphones, suffering, or physical violence.

My home is a more productive environment than the office when I have to get stuff done.
