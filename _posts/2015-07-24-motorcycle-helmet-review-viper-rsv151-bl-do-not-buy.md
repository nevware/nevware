I&#8217;ve ridden motorbikes for more than 20 years. I&#8217;ve owned and ridden Hondas, BMWs and Kawasakis. My current ride is a BMW R850R, and I love it &#8211; comfortable, fast, maneuverable, and reliable.

A few weeks ago, I bought a new helmet &#8211; a Viper RSV151 BL+. I&#8217;d ownedÂ  a Viper helmet before, and found it comfortable and quiet enough for around town.

The RSV151 is a terrible helmet. The main reason is that I cannot close the flip-up face mask with one hand &#8211; the helmet isn&#8217;t rigid enough, so when it&#8217;s on my head, the notches don&#8217;t quite line up. That means you need two hands to close the flip-up, which doesn&#8217;t really work on a motorbike.

Other issues are that the helmet is very noisy &#8211; even at 30mph, I cannot hear the bluetooth. The bluetooth is unreliable &#8211; I keep dropping calls.

So, even though it&#8217;s a cheap helmet, especially with the built-in bluetooth, it&#8217;s a terrible purchase.
