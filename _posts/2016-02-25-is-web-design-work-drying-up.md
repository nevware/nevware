I was listening to the Tim Ferris podcast where he interview [Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/). Seth publishes a new post every day. I&#8217;m going to try to write more.

I stumbled across a post on Hacker News called &#8220;[The Elephant in the Room: Web design work is drying up (sazzy.co.uk)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11168994)&#8220;. The conversation got pretty heated.

The original article is about life as a web design freelancer &#8211; which is a fair way from my life as an employee of a large digital agency, working in technology. But the basic trends are probably the same.

I think it boils down to three trends.

Anyone who needs a website probably already has one. And many businesses have decided (for better or worse) to stick with a social media presence, and not to put too much effort into their website.

Secondly &#8211; companies that do need a website almost certainly need more than just a nice static web presence. They may need a complex ecommerce site, or a dynamic web application, or &#8211; well, whatever. These projects typically need specialist skills, rather than a generalist.

Thirdly &#8211; for the simpler web sites, the &#8220;off the shelf&#8221; tools are getting better. A WordPress site, with a custom theme and a few nice plug-ins delivers the same business value as a custom-developed website did 5 years ago.
