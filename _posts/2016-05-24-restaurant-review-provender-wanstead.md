Last week, we went for a sunday lunch at [Provender](http://www.provenderlondon.co.uk/), on Wanstead High Street, in North East London.

It&#8217;s a small French restaurant, and pretty much every table was taken, including the small area outside (we&#8217;d booked in advance). The interior is bright, and tasteful, without being pretentious.

We had the big starter platter &#8211; Hors d&#8217;oeuvre &#8220;Royale&#8221; &#8211; which was frankly amazing. Charcuterie, a very nice rilette, and a celeriac remoulade that I will have to experiment with. The other side of the platter was fish &#8211; smoked salmon, salmon mousse, and small sections of what looked like sword fish (I don&#8217;t eat fish). The charcuterie was spectacular &#8211; two sliced dried sausage varieties that were subtle, but each had a distinctive flavour I can still taste 2 days later&#8230;

My main was the steak tartare. I love tartare &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to find in the UK. The Provender tartare was minced by hand, and it makes a difference &#8211; the texture was much more interesting. The flavour was robust &#8211; the seasoning was just the right side of aggressive, and the meat was clearly from a good butcher.

My lunch partner had the coquilles St Jacques, served with saffron risotto. She smiled beatifically, and reported a state of bliss.

For desert, I had the blackcurrant sorbet &#8211; rich with a cassis liqueur, and very fruity. My lunch partner chose the chocolate tart, which may well be the most chocolatey thing I have ever tasted.

We had a nice bottle of wine; the total bill came to just over Â£100. Excellent value for money.  
Thoroughly recommended.
